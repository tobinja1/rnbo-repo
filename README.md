# Rnbo repo

A place for all of [Jay Tobin's](https://jaytobin.com/) [rnbo~](https://rnbo.cycling74.com/) patches, to be used freely by anyone who finds them.

For instruction on how to load rnbo~ patches onto your webpage, [see here](https://rnbo.cycling74.com/learn/getting-the-rnbojs-library). If you're working with web, you can easily reference these files in your js to add some neat sounds to your projects. 

**More to come soon,** including documentation on how to load these into your site + the actual js used to get the patches working!
